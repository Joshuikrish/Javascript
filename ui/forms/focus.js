/*Events focus and blur trigger on an element focusing/losing focus.

Their specials are:

They do not bubble. Can use capturing state instead or focusin/focusout.
Most elements do not support focus by default. Use tabindex to make anything focusable.
The current focused element is available as document.activeElement.*/
