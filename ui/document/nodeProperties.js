    /*Each DOM node belongs to a certain class. The classes form a hierarchy. The full set of properties and methods come as the result of inheritance.

Main DOM node properties are:

nodeType
We can use it to see if a node is a text or an element node. It has a numeric value: 1 for elements,3 for text nodes, and a few others for other node types. Read-only.
nodeName/tagName
For elements, tag name (uppercased unless XML-mode). For non-element nodes nodeName describes what it is. Read-only.
innerHTML
The HTML content of the element. Can be modified.
outerHTML
The full HTML of the element. A write operation into elem.outerHTML does not touch elem itself. Instead it gets replaced with the new HTML in the outer context.
nodeValue/data
The content of a non-element node (text, comment). These two are almost the same, usually we use data. Can be modified.
textContent
The text inside the element: HTML minus all <tags>. Writing into it puts the text inside the element, with all special characters and tags treated exactly as text. Can safely insert user-generated text and protect from unwanted HTML insertions.
hidden
When set to true, does the same as CSS display:none.
DOM nodes also have other properties depending on their class. For instance, <input> elements (HTMLInputElement) support value, type, while <a> elements (HTMLAnchorElement) support href etc. Most standard HTML attributes have a corresponding DOM property.

However, HTML attributes and DOM properties are not always the same, as we’ll see in the next chapter.*/
