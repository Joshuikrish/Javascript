/*MutationObserver can react to changes in DOM – attributes, text content and adding/removing elements.

We can use it to track changes introduced by other parts of our code, as well as to integrate with third-party scripts.

MutationObserver can track any changes. The config “what to observe” options are used for optimizations, not to spend resources on unneeded callback invocations.*/
