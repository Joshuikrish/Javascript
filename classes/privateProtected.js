/**
 * To hide an internal interface we use either protected or private properties:

Protected fields start with _. Thatâ€™s a well-known convention, not enforced at the language level. Programmers should only access a field starting with _ from its class and classes inheriting from it.
Private fields start with #. JavaScript makes sure we can only access those from inside the class.
