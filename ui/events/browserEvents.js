/*There are 3 ways to assign event handlers:

HTML attribute: onclick="...".
DOM property: elem.onclick = function.
Methods: elem.addEventListener(event, handler[, phase]) to add, removeEventListener to remove.
HTML attributes are used sparingly, because JavaScript in the middle of an HTML tag looks a little bit odd and alien. Also can’t write lots of code in there.

DOM properties are ok to use, but we can’t assign more than one handler of the particular event. In many cases that limitation is not pressing.

The last way is the most flexible, but it is also the longest to write. There are few events that only work with it, for instance transitionend and DOMContentLoaded (to be covered). Also addEventListener supports objects as event handlers. In that case the method handleEvent is called in case of the event.

No matter how you assign the handler – it gets an event object as the first argument. That object contains the details about what’s happened.

We’ll learn more about events in general and about different types of events in the next chapters.


Mouse events:

click – when the mouse clicks on an element (touchscreen devices generate it on a tap).
contextmenu – when the mouse right-clicks on an element.
mouseover / mouseout – when the mouse cursor comes over / leaves an element.
mousedown / mouseup – when the mouse button is pressed / released over an element.
mousemove – when the mouse is moved.
Keyboard events:

keydown and keyup – when a keyboard key is pressed and released.
Form element events:

submit – when the visitor submits a <form>.
focus – when the visitor focuses on an element, e.g. on an <input>.
Document events:

DOMContentLoaded – when the HTML is loaded and processed, DOM is fully built.
CSS events:

transitionend – when a CSS-animation finishes.
There are many other events. We’ll get into more details of particular events in upcoming chapters.
