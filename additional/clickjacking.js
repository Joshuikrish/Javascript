/*Clickjacking is a way to “trick” users into clicking on a victim site without even knowing what’s happening. That’s dangerous if there are important click-activated actions.

A hacker can post a link to their evil page in a message, or lure visitors to their page by some other means. There are many variations.

From one perspective – the attack is “not deep”: all a hacker is doing is intercepting a single click. But from another perspective, if the hacker knows that after the click another control will appear, then they may use cunning messages to coerce the user into clicking on them as well.

The attack is quite dangerous, because when we engineer the UI we usually don’t anticipate that a hacker may click on behalf of the visitor. So vulnerabilities can be found in totally unexpected places.

It is recommended to use X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN on pages (or whole websites) which are not intended to be viewed inside frames.
Use a covering <div> if we want to allow our pages to be shown in iframes, but still stay safe.*/
